Welcome to MoodLog
MoodLog is an Emotion Tracking Web App that permits a user to record snapshots of their emotional state at arbitrary times throughout the day for subsequent review in an effort to facilitate insight into the user’s emotions over time. Accordingly, a single snapshot of a user’s emotional state will contain values indicating the level of emotion currently being experienced for each of the seven universal emotions: enjoyment, sadness, anger, contempt, disgust, fear, surprise. In addition, the snapshot contains a timestamp indicating the date and time of the snapshot, along with an optional set of possible triggers that may provide context for the emotional state recorded in the snapshot. Subsequently, the web appwill enable the user to view changes in their levels of universal emotions over time and identify any related contextual triggers.
